! Amazon Web Services
! Virtual Private Cloud

! AWS utilizes unique identifiers to manipulate the configuration of
! a VPN Connection. Each VPN Connection is assigned an identifier and is
! associated with two other identifiers, namely the
! Customer Gateway Identifier and Virtual Private Gateway Identifier.
!
! Your VPN Connection ID 		  : vpn-098051f70ffae4322
! Your Virtual Private Gateway ID         : 
! Your Customer Gateway ID		  : cgw-037c5b8229434f087
!
!
! This configuration consists of two tunnels. Both tunnels must be
! configured on your Customer Gateway.
!
! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! IPSec Tunnel #1
! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! #1: Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Configuration
!
! A policy is established for the supported ISAKMP encryption,
! authentication, Diffie-Hellman, lifetime, and key parameters.
! Please note, these sample configurations are for the minimum requirement of AES128, SHA1, and DH Group 2.
! Category "VPN" connections in the GovCloud region have a minimum requirement of AES128, SHA2, and DH Group 14.
! You will need to modify these sample configuration files to take advantage of AES256, SHA256, or other DH groups like 2, 14-18, 22, 23, and 24.
! NOTE: If you customized tunnel options when creating or modifying your VPN connection, you may need to modify these sample configurations to match the custom settings for your tunnels.
!
! Higher parameters are only available for VPNs of category "VPN," and not for "VPN-Classic".
! The address of the external interface for your customer gateway must be a static address.
! Your customer gateway may reside behind a device performing network address translation (NAT).
! To ensure that NAT traversal (NAT-T) can function, you must adjust your firewall !rules to unblock UDP port 4500.
! If not behind NAT, and you are not using an Accelerated VPN, we recommend disabling NAT-T. If you are using an Accelerated VPN, make sure that NAT-T is enabled.
!
! Note that there are a global list of ISAKMP policies, each identified by
! sequence number. This policy is defined as #200, which may conflict with
! an existing policy using the same number. If so, we recommend changing
! the sequence number to avoid conflicts.
!

! The ISAKMP keyring stores the Pre Shared Key used to authenticate the
! tunnel endpoints.

  pre-shared-key address 3.212.220.244 key awsamazon
exit

! An ISAKMP profile is used to associate the keyring with the particular
! endpoint.
!

  match identity address 3.212.220.244
  keyring keyring-vpn-098051f70ffae4322-0
exit

! #2: IPSec Configuration
!
! The IPSec transform set defines the encryption, authentication, and IPSec
! mode parameters.
! Category "VPN" connections in the GovCloud region have a minimum requirement of AES128, SHA2, and DH Group 14.
! Please note, you may use these additionally supported IPSec parameters for encryption like AES256 and other DH groups like 2, 5, 14-18, 22, 23, and 24.
! NOTE: If you customized tunnel options when creating or modifying your VPN connection, you may need to modify these sample configurations to match the custom settings for your tunnels.
!
! Higher parameters are only available for VPNs of category "VPN," and not for "VPN-Classic".
!

! The IPSec profile references the IPSec transform set and further defines
! the Diffie-Hellman group and security association lifetime.
!
crypto ipsec profile ipsec-vpn-098051f70ffae4322-0
  set pfs group2
  set security-association lifetime seconds 3600
  set transform-set ipsec-prop-vpn-098051f70ffae4322-0
exit

! Additional parameters of the IPSec configuration are set here. Note that
! these parameters are global and therefore impact other IPSec
! associations.
! This option instructs the router to clear the "Don't Fragment"
! bit from packets that carry this bit and yet must be fragmented, enabling
! them to be fragmented.
!
crypto ipsec df-bit clear

! This option enables IPSec Dead Peer Detection, which causes periodic
! messages to be sent to ensure a Security Association remains operational.
! If you are using Accelerated AWS VPN, please configure periodic Dead Peer Detection.
! isakmp keepalive threshold 10 retry 10 periodic
!
crypto isakmp keepalive threshold 10 retry 10

! This configures the gateway's window for accepting out of order
! IPSec packets. A larger window can be helpful if too many packets
! are dropped due to reordering while in transit between gateways.
!
crypto ipsec security-association replay window-size 128

! This option instructs the router to fragment the unencrypted packets
! (prior to encryption).
!
crypto ipsec fragmentation before-encryption


! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! #3: Tunnel Interface Configuration
!
! A tunnel interface is configured to be the logical interface associated
! with the tunnel. All traffic routed to the tunnel interface will be
! encrypted and transmitted to the VPC. Similarly, traffic from the VPC
! will be logically received on this interface.
!
! Association with the IPSec security association is done through the
! "tunnel protection" command.
!
! The address of the interface is configured with the setup for your
! Customer Gateway.  If the address changes, the Customer Gateway and VPN
! Connection must be recreated with Amazon VPC.

  ! TCP packets to prevent packet fragmentation.

! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

! #4: Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Configuration
!
! BGP is used within the tunnel to exchange prefixes between the
! Virtual Private Gateway and your Customer Gateway. The Virtual Private Gateway
! will announce the prefix corresponding to your VPC.
!
! Your Customer Gateway may announce a default route (0.0.0.0/0),
! which can be done with the 'network' and 'default-originate' statements.
!
! The BGP timers are adjusted to provide more rapid detection of outages.
!
! The local BGP Autonomous System Number (ASN) (65001) is configured
! as part of your Customer Gateway. If the ASN must be changed, the
! Customer Gateway and VPN Connection will need to be recreated with AWS.
