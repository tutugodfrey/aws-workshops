! Amazon Web Services
! Virtual Private Cloud

! AWS utilizes unique identifiers to manipulate the configuration of
! a VPN Connection. Each VPN Connection is assigned an identifier and is
! associated with two other identifiers, namely the
! Customer Gateway Identifier and Virtual Private Gateway Identifier.
!
! Your VPN Connection ID 		              : vpn-066d770ab9bf5441f
! Your Virtual Private Gateway ID         : 
! Your Customer Gateway ID		            : cgw-07a7b0d285d0af104
!
!
! This configuration consists of two tunnels. Both tunnels must be
! configured on your Customer Gateway.
!
! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! IPSec Tunnel #1
! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! #1: Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Configuration
!
! A policy is established for the supported ISAKMP encryption,
! authentication, Diffie-Hellman, lifetime, and key parameters.
! Please note, these sample configurations are for the minimum requirement of AES128, SHA1, and DH Group 2.
! Category "VPN" connections in the GovCloud region have a minimum requirement of AES128, SHA2, and DH Group 14.
! You will need to modify these sample configuration files to take advantage of AES256, SHA256, or other DH groups like 2, 14-18, 22, 23, and 24.
! NOTE: If you customized tunnel options when creating or modifying your VPN connection, you may need to modify these sample configurations to match the custom settings for your tunnels.
!
! Higher parameters are only available for VPNs of category "VPN," and not for "VPN-Classic".
!
! The address of the external interface for your customer gateway must be a static address.
! Your customer gateway may reside behind a device performing network address translation (NAT).
! To ensure that NAT traversal (NAT-T) can function, you must adjust your firewall rules to unblock UDP port 4500.
! If not behind NAT, and you are not using an Accelerated VPN, we recommend disabling NAT-T. If you are using an Accelerated VPN, make sure that NAT-T is enabled.
!
! Configuration begins in root VDOM.

 next
end


! #2: IPSec Configuration
!
! The IPSec transform set defines the encryption, authentication, and IPSec
! mode parameters.
!
! Category "VPN" connections in the GovCloud region have a minimum requirement of AES128, SHA2, and DH Group 14.
! Please note, you may use these additionally supported IPSec parameters for encryption like AES256 and other DH groups like 2, 5, 14-18, 22, 23, and 24.
! Higher parameters are only available for VPNs of category "VPN," and not for "VPN-Classic".

  set dhgrp 2
  set pfs enable
  set keylifeseconds 3600
 next

! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! #3: Tunnel Interface Configuration
!
! A tunnel interface is configured to be the logical interface associated
! with the tunnel. All traffic routed to the tunnel interface will be
! encrypted and transmitted to the VPC. Similarly, traffic from the VPC
! will be logically received on this interface.
!
!
! The address of the interface is configured with the setup for your
! Customer Gateway.  If the address changes, the Customer Gateway and VPN
! Connection must be recreated with Amazon VPC.
! Perform this from the Global VDOM.

config global
config system interface
 edit "vpn-066d770ab9bf5441f-0"
  set vdom "root"
  set ip 169.254.80.126 255.255.255.255
  set allowaccess ping
  set type tunnel

!  This option causes the router to reduce the Maximum Segment Size of
!  TCP packets to prevent packet fragmentation.
!
  set tcp-mss 1379
  set remote-ip 169.254.80.125
  set mtu 1427
  set interface "wan1"
 next


! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! #4: Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Configuration
!
! BGP is used within the tunnel to exchange prefixes between the
! Virtual Private Gateway and your Customer Gateway. The Virtual Private Gateway
! will announce the prefix corresponding to your VPC.
!
!
! The local BGP Autonomous System Number (ASN) (65000)
! is configured as part of your Customer Gateway. If the ASN must
! be changed, the Customer Gateway and VPN Connection will need to be recreated with AWS.
! Configuration begins in root VDOM.

config vdom
    edit root
      config router bgp
        set as 65000
      config neighbor
        edit 169.254.80.125
        set remote-as 64512
end

! Your Customer Gateway may announce a default route (0.0.0.0/0) to us.
! This is done using prefix list and route-map in Fortigate.

config router bgp
 config neighbor
  edit 169.254.80.125
   set capability-default-originate enable
   end
 end

config router prefix-list
 edit "default_route"
  config rule
   edit 1
    set prefix 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0
   next
  end
 set router-id 3.238.76.222
end

config router route-map
 edit "routemap1"
  config rule
   edit 1
    set match-ip-address "default_route"
   next
  end
 next
end

! To advertise additional prefixes to Amazon VPC, add these prefixes to the 'network'
! statement and identify the prefix you wish to advertise. Make sure the prefix is present
! in the routing table of the device with a valid next-hop. If you want to advertise
! 192.168.0.0/16 to Amazon, this can be done using the following:

config router bgp
config network
 edit 1
  set prefix 192.168.0.0 255.255.0.0
 next
end
set router-id 3.238.76.222
end

! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! #5 Firewall Policy Configuration
!
! Create a firewall policy permitting traffic from your local subnet to the VPC subnet and vice versa
!
! This example policy permits all traffic from the local subnet to the VPC
! First, find the policies that exist
! Configuration begins in root VDOM.

config vdom
    edit root
      show firewall policy

! Next, create a new firewall policy starting with the next available policy ID. If policies 1, 2, 3, and 4 were shown, then in this example the policy created starts 5

config firewall policy
edit 5
set srcintf "vpn-066d770ab9bf5441f-0"
set dstintf internal
 set srcaddr all
 set dstaddr all
set action accept
set schedule always

next
end

! Now create a policy to permit traffic going the other way
